  <b/> ** Learning by Doing **  
  
  This is the project through which I will be carrying out data exploration, visualization and applying basic probabilistic model for my own learning and growth.  
  The project also includes exploring use of scikit learn package for implementing k-fold crossvalidation, and methods of analysing model performance.

The movie recommendation model is based on naive bayes algorithm.

Note: The movie rating data was collected by the GroupLens Research group from the MovieLens website (http://movielens.org) and used here for educational purpose only.


To acknowledge the use of the MovieLens dataset for my personal learning, I would like to cite the following paper:
